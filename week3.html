<p><h1><cite><strong>Malala Yousafzai </strong></cite></h1><b>Topic</b> se<sup>n</sup>tences are <i>similar</i> to mini th<sub>e</sub>sis <u>statements.</u> Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. <tt>Whereas the thesis is the</tt> main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a <big>topic sentence</big> has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity.<br><hr> An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the <small>sentences relate </small>to the topic sentence. <em>Note:</em> Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>
